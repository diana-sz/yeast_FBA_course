    "This notebook provides an introduction to constraint-based metabolic modelling with COBRApy, followed by several practical exercisesm where you will be expected to fill out the missing code.\n",

    "## COBRApy\n",
    "COBRApy is a python package for constraint-based metabolic modelling. It contains functions for running various analyses, such as FBA, pFBA, FVA, flux sampling, building and editing models...\n",
    "Here you can find the [COBRApy documentation](https://cobrapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).  \n",
    "In case you prefer MATLAB, there is [COBRA Toolbox](https://opencobra.github.io/cobratoolbox/stable/). It has additional functionalities compared to COBRApy (e.g. omics integration).\n",
    "\n",
    "COBRApy can read various model file types. We will use **SBML** (Systems Biology Markup Language) - one of the standard formats how to store a model. The advantage of this format is that it is both human an machine readable. This is what a reaction looks like:\n",

    "A common way how to achieve growth coupling is by making certain knock-out(s). These ensure that the cell has to produce the product of interest (basically because all other alternative pathways are gone). There are algorithms which can predict these, such as **OptKnock, RobustKnock, OptCouple**... However, they are computationally demanding (take a long time to run, especially if you are looking for double, triple, quadruple... KOs, because they have to test all possible combinations of KOs).\n",
